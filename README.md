# LeetCode Solutions in C 🚀

Welcome to my repository of **LeetCode algorithm problem solutions**, all implemented in the **C programming language**! This project is designed to help developers and students improve their algorithmic thinking, master problem-solving techniques, and deepen their understanding of C.

---

## 📂 What This Repository Contains

This repository includes solutions to a wide variety of LeetCode problems, ranging across:

- **Problem Types**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Searching, and more.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard problems.

Each solution is written with clarity and efficiency in mind, following best practices in C programming.

## 🖥️ Why C?

C is a powerful, low-level programming language that provides a deep understanding of how computers work. I chose C for these solutions because:

- It’s **fast and efficient**, making it ideal for solving algorithmic problems.
- It helps build a **strong foundation** in memory management and data structures.
- Many technical interviews test candidates' ability to write clean and efficient C code.

By solving problems in C, you’ll not only improve your algorithmic skills but also gain a deeper appreciation for the language itself.

## 📁 Repository Organization

The repository is structured to make navigation simple and intuitive:

- **By Difficulty**: Solutions are grouped into folders named `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.
- **By Topic**: Within each difficulty folder, problems are further categorized by topic (e.g., `Arrays`, `Trees`, `DynamicProgramming`).

Each solution file is named after the problem title (e.g., `two_sum.c`), and includes comments explaining the approach and logic.

## 🔍 How to Navigate and Use the Code

1. **Browse the Folders**: Start by exploring the `Easy`, `Medium`, or `Hard` folders based on your current skill level.
2. **Pick a Topic**: Dive into a specific topic folder to focus on areas like Trees or Dynamic Programming.
3. **Read the Code**: Each solution is well-commented to help you understand the thought process behind it.
4. **Run the Code**: Compile and run the C files to test the solutions yourself. Feel free to tweak the code and experiment!
